This is Chaos, a "toy" language used to test Coldstore.  Being a
whitespace-delimited RPN stack-based language, Chaos superficially
resembles forth -- but it is not forth, or even a partial
implementation of forth.  Chaos does not include a number of forth
words, and implements other words differently.  Chaos has no control
words that change parsing order: *everything* is RPN, no exceptions.

Chaos is a testbed, and as such is constantly under revision, so the
entire language specification may change on a whim.  Basing a
production system on Chaos is not advisable.  That said, Chaos has
been designed for easy extensibility, and we encourage experimentation
with it.  Suggestions for improving Chaos are also encouraged, but new
primitives or parse structures will be considered against our desire
to keep the language minimal.
