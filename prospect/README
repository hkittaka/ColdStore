Run 'make' in this directory, then run prospect.  It will take a good looooong
time to run, while it pokes through your absolute memory map.  It will notify
you when it finds a section it cannot use.  Use the largest chunk that shows
up as available, by editing the parameters in qvmm.h (this will be moved to
a configuration file soon).

Any time you upgrade your operating system or linker or system libs, you'll
need to run prospect again to ensure that it hasn't created any new holes.
If it does create a hole where a coldstore is currently mapped, you are out of
luck and had better revert -- this will eventually change when qvmm supports
some system of relocation.
