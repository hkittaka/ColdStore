README for coldstore/libs
        Sun Aug  1 16:11:33 EST 1999

Sadly, there's what I call a bug in ld-linux.so and libdl.so which causes absolute symbols to be relocated.  I'm in discussion with the maintainers of these programs to see how it can best be resolved.

In the meantime, here are working versions for:
        glibc 2.1.1-13
        gcc version egcs-2.91.66 Debian GNU/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
        binutils 2.9.1.0.25-2
        Linux 2.2.10 i686 unknown

The includes/Makefile.inc make include file references the copies of these files in the libs/ directory

Colin.
