** PRIORITY and BUGFIXES

Protect lock-clean tasks by generating the ~deadlock in another task
in the wait cycle.  A task is lock-clean if it requests locks in
increasing order of address.  A task is garanteed to be lock-clean if
it requests all the locks it'll need on the first Tram::lock call.
Further calls to Tram::lock are possible if they represent subsets of
the first call, or if all the new requests are for higher addresses
than all locks already granted.  In every deadlock situation, we have
at least one lock-dirty task in the wait cycle.

Make Guard throw something that can be decoded and displayed at a higher level.
