	really are, and nobody will really know where lieth those little 
	things wi-- with the sort of raffia work base that has an attachment.
	At this time, a friend shall lose his friend's hammer and the young 
	shall not know where lieth the things possessed by their fathers 
	that their fathers put there only just the night before, about

ColdStore is a gigabyte-scale persistent object store which mmap()s objects into a file (for persistence), can allocate objects in a minimal working-set of pages (for speed), permits library versions to change without a rebuild of the store, and permits application checkpoint/restart. 

ColdStore might be used to replace a database, cache highly structured objects, act as an OODB, act as a Document Store for XML/SGML/HTML, make STL persistent, create a MUD or a VM workbench. 

See http://coldstore.sourceforge.net for more information.

REQUIREMENTS
ColdStore requires the following:

* A recent Linux 2.2+ or FreeBSD 4.0 system.  
  Other OS's and versions have not been tested and probably will not build
  without major work.  Porting efforts for other OS's are welcome.

* gcc 2.95.2 (Linux)
  (Later version for BSD -- Still in development at this time, so don't
  install it over your existing installation of gcc.
  gcc 2.95 will work, but you'll have to get 
  libstdc++ 3.0, and possibly change makefiles to point to it.)

* OpenC++

* libelf (Linux already has it, other platforms use the provided version)

* libiberty -- this is part of the binutils-dev package in Debian.  If you build
  your own gcc, then its likely you already have it.  Used to demangle C++ 
  symbols.

Some handy Debian packages:
 * libelfg0-dev
 * libgmp3-dev
 * libpcre3-dev
 * openc++
 * libgc5-dev
 * binutils-dev
 * autoconf
 * flex

=======================================

To Port to another system/architecture:
* A LARGE chunk of unreserved virtual memory, the larger the better.
  Follow the directions in prospect/README to find this chunk on your system.
* There's a small amount of assembler and gcc-i386 specific stuff around.
  Get in touch, the team will help you port.
