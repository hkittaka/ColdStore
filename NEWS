Well, I've just spent some of the time necessary to get configure to work with
our project.  There's going ot need to be a few more passes before I get it
right.  And then we need to add some magic to do the tests/configuration
that was done with the mk file templates.  After that, we're nearly set to
do tar based distributions.
