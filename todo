RYAN's todo:

	* generic lexer/scanner to replace chaos, freon, and chatter lexers
	  - wrap gscanner from glib?  (dependency we may not want)
	  - write from scratch?
	  - find another lexer to copy?
	  - wrap flex up in a more OO way?
	  - find other lexer generators?

	* refactor MOP for Data and sub-types
	  - split into common, scalar, sequence, and map methods
	  - use metaobject slot in Message?

	* rework Binding/Variable/Closure
	  - one Binding for both Closure and subClosures - shared bindings, with
		push/pop on closure entry/exit for lexical scope

	* rework chatter parser until factorial example compiles and runs

	* rewrite chatter and freon lexers using generic lexer framework

	* rewrite freon parser by hand, lightly based on the ecmascript parser
	  written in java

	* embed freon and chatter into the mud

	* get ready for release
